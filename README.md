# Home field advantage (hfa) analysis of local adaptation in crop populations. 

Input data should be analogous to common gardens. Ex. breeding trials, multi environment trials, yield trials. Largely works on R 4.1, though not compiled (yet... very much in progress!). For now, you'll have to source().

## Brief how-to:

1. Install dependencies (functions will load): `libs = c("magrittr", "car", "lme4", "Matrix", "parallel", "permute"); for (i in libs) install.packages(i)`
1. id_home() to identify home site (optional)
2. permute_hfa() to run hfa analysis. This will work at the population and genotype level and may work across years (for populations) - in progress. You currently need to manually calculate p-values for genotypes from the permutations (first column is observed; try .two-tailed()). If really slow, try setting BLUP=FALSE.
3. temporal_hfa() for calculationg hfa across years at the population level.

See analysis code for publications below and methods described in those publications - especially Ewing et al. (2019). All functions are relatively documented in source code. 

The median (quantile) regression approach of Ewing et al. (2019) has not yet been transferred to this package - only ordinary least squares (`lm()`-based) and BLUP (`lmer()`-based) are. Of the two, BLUP is more robust to low sample sizes (site-years per genotype) and outliers but also is substantially slower. 

Of course, message with questions.
